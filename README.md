## ABOUT THE APP
A standalone application that makes use of Machine Learning to try and recognise a hand-drawn (or rather, mouse-drawn) digit.

## HOW IT WORKS
Upon running, the app will provide you with a blank white interface on which you can draw a digit with your mouse, by clicking and dragging.
The app will then capture an image of the digit drawn and pass it to a neural network which will predict which digit has been drawn.

## HOW TO RUN
To run this app, follow these simple steps:
- See that you have `Conda` installed by running the command `conda --v` in command prompt. If installed, it will display the conda version. If not, see here how to install it.
